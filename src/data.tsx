      "Isn't a 'crypto whale' an individual or entity that holds a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency, yeah?",

    explanation:
      "Correct! A 'crypto whale' refers to individuals or entities that hold large amounts of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trading activities.",

    question: "Is Bitcoin's maximum supply capped at 30 million coins?",
    correctAnswer: "NO",
    explanation:
      "Bitcoin's maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins, not 30 million. This scarcity is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin's design and value proposition.",

    correctAnswer: "YES",

      "HODL originated from a typo in a Bitcoin forum post in 2013 where someone wrote 'I AM HODLING' instead of 'holding'. It became a meme and philosophy about holding onto crypto despite market volatility.",

    correctAnswer: "YES",

    question: "Is a 'rug pull' a positive event where developers rapidly increase the value of their cryptocurrency?",
